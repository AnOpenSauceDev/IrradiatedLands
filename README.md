A goofy fallout-inspired "mod".

This mod was originally made ages ago in a day or so for a short part in a personal event among friends. Because of that, the mod content is super barebones.

Ignore the oddly recent commit before this README was made, I forgot to actually add the files back then.


I'm probably going to work on this more nowadays, but don't take my word for it.
